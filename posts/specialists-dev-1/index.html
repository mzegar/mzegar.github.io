<time datetime=2021-05-26>May 26, 2021</time><br><p>I&rsquo;ve had access to s&box for a little bit&mldr; here are my thoughts on s&box, alongside a showcase of what I&rsquo;ve been
working on.</p><h5 id=the-specialists-reloaded>&ldquo;The Specialists Reloaded&rdquo;</h5><p>The first time I ever played the Half-Life 1 mod &ldquo;The Specialists&rdquo;, I was extremely surprised how much it overhauled the
base Half-Life experience. It had it all: fast movement, bullet-time, and source-like gun play. So this is exactly what I&rsquo;m
going to be bringing to s&box.</p><p>Here are a few quick gifs of some movement mechanics I&rsquo;ve managed to bring over from the original mod&mldr;</p><p>Backflipping off walls

<img src=/images/specialists-dev-1/2.gif alt=dive></p><h5 id=sbox-thoughts>S&box Thoughts</h5><p>S&box is going to be a game changer. Here&rsquo;s a quick summary of why I think so&mldr;</p><ul><li>The developer experience is really really nice<ul><li>Hot reloadable C# code</li><li>C# provides IDE auto complete and auto formatting</li></ul></li><li>Valve&rsquo;s updated tools are extremely well done and easy to pickup<ul><li>Modeldoc, Hammer, etc.</li></ul></li><li>Source 2 as a base<ul><li>It&rsquo;s freaking Source 2!!</li></ul></li></ul><p>However, I am a bit scared with one design choice that may lead to quite a few problems in the future. Inheritance hell.
Almost every single class you&rsquo;ll be creating will extend some class that extends another class that extends another class that&mldr;
you get the point. An example would be the movement code I&rsquo;ve written so far for my mod. This movement class is &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to
extend from a bunch of classes.</p><pre><code>ReloadedMovementController -&gt; WalkController -&gt; BasePlayerController -&gt; PawnController
</code></pre><p>This is definitely a deliberate choice made by the folks over at FacePunch, as they clearly have experience with engines that
mostly minimize this issue such as Unity. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how it pans out. Regardless, I&rsquo;m probably out of my lane
right now (as I&rsquo;m just a uni student with a few months of internship experience using Unity).</p><h5 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s next?</h5><p>I&rsquo;m waiting for goldsrc importing to be implemented as I&rsquo;m going to be using the original &ldquo;The Specialists&rdquo; models initially.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
