I was recently given access to [s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/news) (thanks to Minh & Garry). The amount of potential in terms of creating amazing
gamemodes is magnitudes higher than anything found in [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/).

### First "Addon"

Already within hours of receiving s&box I have published my first addon. It allows users to easily create a crosshair similar to what is found in most popular FPS games.

### What's next

The end goal is remaking the popular Half-Life mod ["The Specialists"](https://mzegar.github.io/the-specialists-reloaded-site/). I'm currently waiting on goldsrc model
importing to be finished before I start, so meanwhile I'm just going to be messing about.
