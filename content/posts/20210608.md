I'm currently taking a break from my original "The Specialists" project to work on [TTT Reborn](https://github.com/TTTReborn/ttt-reborn).
As someone who has played thousands of hours of the original [TTT](https://ttt.badking.net/), I am excited to be a part of the 
team that is remaking the gamemode for [s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/news).

### Networking in s&box

I haven't had the opportunity yet to take any networking classes at my university yet. It made me a bit worried when I decided
to write some networking code needed for TTT Reborn. However, it was a breeze. It's literally as simple as just adding
a [decorator](https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/Networked_Types) around a variable to network it to other players. This ease of
use allowed me to implement a fully fledged round system, and a body inspecting system.

Here is a quick snippet of code...

```csharp
[Net, Local] // Now networked locally to players!
public RoleType Role { get; set; }
```

### HUD Preview

Lastly, here's a quick preview of the progress so far.
