&amp;ldquo;The Specialists Reloaded&amp;rdquo; The first time I ever played the Half-Life 1 mod &amp;ldquo;The Specialists&amp;rdquo;, I was extremely surprised how much it overhauled the base Half-Life experience. It had it all: fast movement, bullet-time, and source-like gun play. So this is exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m going to be bringing to s&amp;amp;box.</description></item><item><title>s&amp;box</title><link>https://mzegar.github.io/posts/sandbox/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mzegar.github.io/posts/sandbox/</guid><description>I was recently given access to s&amp;amp;box (thanks to Minh &amp;amp; Garry). The amount of potential in terms of creating amazing gamemodes is magnitudes higher than anything found in Garry&amp;rsquo;s Mod.
First &amp;ldquo;Addon&amp;rdquo; Already within hours of receiving s&amp;amp;box I have published my first addon. It allows users to easily create a crosshair similar to what is found in most popular FPS games.

What&amp;rsquo;s next The end goal is remaking the popular Half-Life mod &amp;ldquo;The Specialists&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
