As someone who has played thousands of hours of the original TTT, I am excited to be a part of the team that is remaking the gamemode for s&amp;amp;box.
Networking in s&amp;amp;box I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the opportunity yet to take any networking classes at my university yet. It made me a bit worried when I decided to write some networking code needed for TTT Reborn.</description></item><item><title>s&amp;box</title><link>https://mzegar.github.io/posts/20210519/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mzegar.github.io/posts/20210519/</guid><description>I was recently given access to s&amp;amp;box (thanks to Minh &amp;amp; Garry). The amount of potential in terms of creating amazing gamemodes is magnitudes higher than anything found in Garry&amp;rsquo;s Mod.
First &amp;ldquo;Addon&amp;rdquo; Already within hours of receiving s&amp;amp;box I have published my first addon. It allows users to easily create a crosshair similar to what is found in most popular FPS games.

What&amp;rsquo;s next The end goal is remaking the popular Half-Life mod &amp;ldquo;The Specialists&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
